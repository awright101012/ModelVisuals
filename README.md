# Algorithm Visualization Project

This project was created in 2 days using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, inspired by the book ["Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Math Behind Modern AI"](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Machines-Learn-Elegant-Behind/dp/0593185749) by Anil Ananthaswamy 

The purpose of this project is to create an explainer for the machine learning algorithms used at work, focusing on algorithm visualization.

This project is hosted at [https://awright101012.github.io/ModelVisuals](https://awright101012.github.io/ModelVisuals).
